### Project Description

Password strength checker. When ran for the first time, the program asks the user to input their password, and upon hitting the enter button, the program determines whether or not the password is strong enough for any situation. Once the enter button is hit, the user must rerun the program to try another password. There is nothing else this program does; passwords inputted are not stored or remembered. 

This tool is for educational use only. It may be built upon to handle more specific websites and situations, but it is a very simple password checker at this point. EclipseIDE and Javascript were used to make this program. 

Please do not use this tool to allow others to check their passwords only to store it. You should never try to steal anyone's personal information, as this is unethical in the coding and real world. Explicitly state how the program works and what is being done with the user's inputted information if deciding to build upon this code.
